OHLCV Database

  Project Description:
  
  This project utlizes QuestDB an open source time series database and along with the Interactive Brokers Native API. This project was developed with the thought of researching strategies. I used Interactive Brokers to invest their API while very robust to develop a tradign system is not predivcated on being a data supplier. Consequently Interactive BRokers API will only allow for the retriveal of a years worth of historical data, I found this to be restricting when trying to research and develop strategies. 
  
  The goal of this project was the develop a databases of 5 minute bar data for a stock universe.  The idea was to pull data year by year for a select number of years for my purposes 10 years woudl give flexibilty, the database could then be updated as time passes. 
  
I began developing this project because of my passion fro quantitative trading, with the goal of deploying on my personal portfolio. I'm always looking for ways to improve the project, so if anyone is interested in contributing, or if you have any questions or comments, please let me know.
